# Murray Bell's Boolean Spaces Machine

## Elliot Pearl's original README

> Murray Bell created the Boolean Spaces Machine in 1997.  
> The Boolean Spaces Machine is an internet-based database  
> of (non-metrizable) Boolean spaces.  
> Boolean spaces are a particular class of topological spaces: compact,  
> Hausdorff spaces which have a basis consisting of clopen sets.
